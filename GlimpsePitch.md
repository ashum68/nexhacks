# Glimpse: Digital Window for Parents

## Overview

**Glimpse** is a first-of-its-kind "Digital Window" that bridges the emotional and informational gap between parents and their children during the school day. Using Edge-AI masking technology, Glimpse automatically captures and delivers video highlights of a child's classroom milestones—without compromising the privacy of other students or burdening teachers with manual documentation.

## The Problem

Parents face four critical barriers to staying connected with their child's school experience:

**The "Black Box" of School**: Parents are disconnected from their child's development for 8+ hours daily, leading to anxiety and missed opportunities for engagement.

**The Privacy Barrier**: Federal laws (FERPA/COPPA) and state wiretapping statutes make traditional classroom recording illegal and create liability risks for school districts.

**Teacher Burnout**: Existing "connection" apps require teachers to manually capture photos and videos during instruction, leading to inconsistent use and added workload.

**Safety Concerns**: Parents, especially those with special needs children or young students, lack visibility into classroom safety incidents, bullying, or behavioral issues. Without documentation, addressing concerns becomes difficult and reactive rather than proactive.

## The Solution

Glimpse solves the privacy-vs-connection paradox through **Privacy-by-Design Edge AI** technology:

**Automated Capture**: An AI-enabled "smart lens" automatically identifies and captures key moments—participation, social interactions, project completion—without requiring teacher intervention.

**Dynamic Masking**: On-device AI identifies every face in the frame and applies a non-reversible, real-time blur to everyone except the authorized child, ensuring complete privacy compliance.

**Zero-Leak Security**: Raw, unblurred footage never leaves the hardware. Only the anonymized highlight reel is uploaded to the secure parent portal, eliminating privacy risks.

## Why It Matters: Safety & Engagement

Glimpse delivers critical value across multiple dimensions:

**Early Detection & Documentation**: Parents receive immediate alerts for concerning behaviors or incidents, enabling early intervention. All highlights are securely stored, providing objective documentation for addressing safety concerns, bullying, or legal proceedings.

**Special Needs Protection**: For the **7.3 million Special Education students**, Glimpse offers continuous, non-intrusive monitoring that ensures proper care, documents behavioral patterns, verifies IEP compliance, and provides peace of mind for parents of vulnerable children.

**Proactive Safety Culture**: Transparency promotes accountability and deters inappropriate behavior, creating a safer classroom environment while maintaining complete privacy for all students.

**Parent Peace of Mind**: For parents of young children (under 8), the ability to see their child's day reduces anxiety and builds trust in the educational system, especially during critical early years when children may not fully communicate their experiences.

## Market Opportunity

**Primary Target**: **7.3 million** Special Education students where safety and daily monitoring are high-priority requirements, creating an immediate need for automated, privacy-compliant solutions.

**Secondary Market**: **50 million** K-12 students in the U.S. where parents seek deeper engagement and transparency in their child's educational journey.

**Revenue Model**: A **B2B2C SaaS model**—sold to school districts as a safety and transparency tool, with premium "Highlight Reel" subscriptions available to parents who want enhanced features and extended access.

## Competitive Advantage

Unlike existing solutions, **Glimpse is the only platform that is automated, privacy-compliant, and legally pre-cleared**:

- **Security cameras** are invasive, violate privacy laws, and create legal liabilities
- **Teacher-led apps** are manual, inconsistent, and add to educator workload
- **Glimpse** transforms the classroom from a restricted zone into a transparent, celebratory environment that respects privacy while delivering peace of mind

By solving the fundamental tension between transparency and privacy, Glimpse creates a new category of educational technology that serves parents, protects students, and supports teachers.
